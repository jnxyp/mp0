      <p>Hello everyone, my name is Yipeng Xin. I completed my Bachelor's degree in 
        Computer Science with a minor in Economics at McMaster University, and I am 
        currently pursuing a Master of Computer Science at the University of Illinois 
        Urbana-Champaign. Previously, I worked as a Backend Developer at IBM Canada Software Lab, 
        where I built enterprise AI products using TypeScript and Python, focusing on real-time voice processing, 
        microservice migration, and large language model integration. I also run a community website called Fossic.org, 
        which supports game modding communities and provides API and CDN optimization.
